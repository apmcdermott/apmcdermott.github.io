					<figcaption>My friends/old band, Titans of Industry.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>I'm originally from Charlotte, North Carolina. I got my high school diploma from a killer awesome science &amp; math boarding school, studied Linguistics at UNC Chapel Hill for a while, and then I moved up to Boston for school and work.</p> 

				<p>For about 10 months, I was the web admin for a fitness company called Core Barre. Since then, I've been handling the marketing for an indie author from my hometown named Cherokee Stein Ross (her new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Timeslider-Cherokee-Stein-Ross-ebook/dp/B008E7OP8Y/"><em>"Timeslider"</em></a> is really fun, by the way), along with a few freelance gigs there and there.</p>

				<p>When I'm not computering, I <a href="https://soundcloud.com/traviatamusic/sets/originals-doodles">write music</a>, I sing and play keys in a band, explore foreign languages, and ride bikes around when it's not too cold.</p>

				<p>I started toying with web design when I was 10 years-old.</p>

				<p>I wanted to make a Sailor Moon fan site because of reasons, and so I set about doing just that, armed with one of those HOW TO WEBSITE books and an Angelfire account (superior to Geocities, ofc). It was a frilly pink monstrosity, replete with auto-playing MIDI versions of the various Sailor Moon theme songs and blinking text.</p>

				<p>I moved on to teaching myself CSS and whatever was in vogue at the time, but I kinda haven't made it that far beyond where I was in high school/early college. That's actually why I'm applying to GA's WDI, in fact. So's I can learn things and make <em>better</em> Sailor Moon websites. And also learn about databases, backend development, and to be a better web designer in general.</p>
